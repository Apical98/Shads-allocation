This R script contains the analyses carried out for the development of work Partitioning bycatch impact among European shad (Alosa spp.) populations: qualitative insights from otolith microchemistry into population-specific conservation risks. It is a first non-optimised script that will be updated soon. 

The csv file contains the otolith microchemistry data of the two shad species studied and the waters of the rivers studied. In particular, strontium, barium and strontium isotopy values were studied. The csv is the only source of information needed to run the R script.
