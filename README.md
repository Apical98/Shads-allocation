Population-specific bycatch risks in two vulnerable anadromous clupeids: insights from otolith microchemistry.

Otolith microchemistry analysis revealed that bycatch of European shads—allis shad Alosa alosa (L. 1758) and twaite shad Alosa fallax (Lacépède 1803)—in commercial fisheries along the Western Iberian Peninsula affects populations from multiple natal origins. Spatial variation in bycatch risk was evident, with specific marine areas showing high natal origin diversity, suggesting complex dispersal patterns. Notable interspecific differences in natal origin diversity were observed, with A. alosa exhibiting broader diversity than A. fallax. The Mondego River origins consistently dominated the bycatch of A. alosa, while A. fallax displayed a more spatially structured distribution, with Ulla River origins prevailing in the north and Miño River origins in the south. These patterns suggest that while A. alosa exhibits a more diffuse distribution largely independent of proximity to natal rivers, A. fallax retains a more spatially constrained marine distribution, likely reflecting differences in dispersal capacity and philopatric tendencies. Bycatch predominantly comprised individuals from key continental populations, including the Mondego and Miño Rivers for A. alosa and Miño and Ulla Rivers for A. fallax. These findings also indicate that more stable populations, such as those from the Mondego and Miño Rivers, may act as source populations within their respective metapopulations, driving broader dispersal and contributing to regional dynamics. Robust classification models demonstrated high accuracy in assigning natal origins despite inherent uncertainties. These findings emphasize the need for conservation strategies that account for species-specific dispersal patterns and potential bycatch hotspots, providing critical insights into the impacts of bycatch on European shad metapopulation dynamics.
